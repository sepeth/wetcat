_The source code for [the game we made for Whisker Jam 2022](https://sneaksy.itch.io/wet-cat)._

OH DEAR! You were so distracted with the fish smells that you've wondered into the open ocean. Alone.. Wet.. Hungry.. A tummy full of fish is the only way to keep going! 

How To Play:

* Use the arrow keys on the keyboard for movement. 
* You cannot move backwards, the tide will pull you backwards naturally. 
* You can use the currents at the top and bottom to move faster.
* Catch fish to keep your hunger bar above 0.

This game was made for the Whisker Jam 2022 with theme - NO WAY BACK. We incorporated the theme into the game in 2 ways. You are a cat stranded in the ocean, you are unable to make it back to the beach. You also cannot swim backwards!

The game was fun to make, we used it as an opportunity to try out the GODOT Game engine. Unfortunately we used GODOT 4 which is still in development which does not have a WEBGL renderer yet. As such the game has to be downloaded.
